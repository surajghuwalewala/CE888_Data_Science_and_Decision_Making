# Project 1 : Learning under Covariate Shift in the Data (Supervised Learning)
<br>
This project focuses on identifying the effect of covariate shift on the performance of machine learning models.

The datasets used for this project were taken from Kaggle
1. [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
2. [DecMeg2014 - Decoding the Human Brain](https://www.kaggle.com/c/decoding-the-human-brain/data)  

> **NOTE:** The paths mentioned in the script are specific to a Google Colab VM. Also, The script to automatically download and unzip the data in the colab VM environment is already written in the iPython notebooks for both the datasets

## House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
- Shift adaptation done by calculating the training weights.
- Results (RMSE scores)
  - Without adaptation : 0.16349 
  - With adaptation : 0.14370
- The shift adaptation improved the performance of the learning model
 
 
## DecMeg2014 - Decoding the Human Brain
- Shift adaptation done by appying Batch Normalization in CNN.
- Results (Classification accuracy)
  - Without Batch Normalization - 50% (both public and private)
  - With Batch Normalization - 55.5% (Public) & 52.2% (Private)

- The shift adaptation significantly improved the performance of the learning model

> **NOTE:** The above scores were generated by Kaggle as the predictions from both the datasets were submitted to Kaggle for the final evaluation.

The whole analysis on both the datasets were done separately in two different Jupyter notebooks. Both the notebooks have been uploaded in this folder.
